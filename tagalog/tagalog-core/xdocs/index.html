<title>a framework for XML parsing</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Tagalog provides a simple framework for parsing XML documents in Java.
It takes a stream of events from an event-based parser and delivers
them to implementations of the
<a href="apidocs/org/codehaus/tagalog/Tag.html">Tag</a> interface.
Tags are grouped into
<a href="apidocs/org/codehaus/tagalog/TagLibrary.html">TagLibrary</a>s,
and a tag library is responsible for implementing whatever behaviour
is needed during the parse (for example, building objects from some
data model).
The namespace-driven selection of tag libraries and tags is styled
after the similar mechanisms in
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/index.jsp">JSP</a> and
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/">Jelly</a>.
</p>

<p>
Taglog is intended to fill the gap between event-based parsers and
full-blown tree-based XML processing APIs.
If
<ul>
<li>you have a data model that you want to read from an XML file,</li>
<li>and extracting the information from a stream of events seems like
hard work,</li>
<li>but you don't want to pull the whole document into a DOM tree,</li>
</ul>
Tagalog might be the solution you're looking for.
