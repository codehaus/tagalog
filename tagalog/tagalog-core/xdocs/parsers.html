<h1>Parsers</h1>

<p>
Tagalog has adaptors to accept event streams from
<a href="http://www.saxproject.org/">SAX</a> and
<a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/">XPP3</a>
parsers;
new adaptors can be built quite simply.
</p>

<p>
Which parser is more suitable will depend on the kind of environment your
aiming at.
The Java runtime has included a SAX parser from release 1.4,
so if you can guarantee that your code is running on JRE 1.4 the SAX
parser is probably the easier one to manage as it requires no additional
JAR files.
You might want to consider using XPP3 if you're targetting earlier
JRE releases where you might have trouble getting the SAX machinery
to work reliably.
XPP3 might also be faster, although we haven't done any performance
testing to determine whether performance differences between SAX and
XPP3 are noticeable when using Tagalog.
</p>

<h2>Using SAX</h2>

<p>
Tagalog will use the system default SAX parser if you create the
<code>TagalogParser</code> using the
<a href="apidocs/org/codehaus/tagalog/sax/TagalogSAXParserFactory.html">TagalogSAXParserFactory</a>.
For a concrete self-contained example look at the
<a href="xref-test/org/codehaus/tagalog/acceptance/sax/BasicSAXTest.html">BasicSAXTest.java</a>.
</p>

<h2>Using XPP3</h2>

<p>
Tagalog will use XPP3 if you create the
<code>TagalogParser</code> using the
<a href="apidocs/org/codehaus/tagalog/xpp/TagalogXmlPullParserFactory.html">TagalogXmlPullParserFactory</a>.
For a concrete self-contained example look at the
<a href="xref-test/org/codehaus/tagalog/acceptance/xpp/BasicXmlPullTest.html">BasicXmlPullTest.java</a>.
</p>

<h2>Behavioural Differences</h2>

<p>
Exception handling differs slightly between the SAX and XPP3 parsers.
When using the XPP3 parser, <code>RuntimeException</code>s thrown by
<code>Tag</code>s (or by Tagalog itself for that matter) pass straight
through the XPP3 parser unmodified.
The Crimson SAX parser that is included with JRE 1.4 catches these
exceptions internally and wraps them in a <code>SAXParseException</code>
that includes information about the position in the parse where the
error occured; Tagalog will then wrap the <code>SAXParseException</code>
in a <code>TagalogParseException</code>.
We could make this consistent but that would mean unwrapping the
<code>SAXParseException</code> and throwing away the information
about where the error occurred.
