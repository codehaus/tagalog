project:
  * project.xml refactoring
  * use of ../project.xml or use installed version in a repo ala XFire
  * license?

core:
  * smart xml content trimming
  * check that setters have void return type
  * converter for char
  * converters for float, double
  * split el into a separate project as it's a more likely to be a evaluation-
    time dependency than a parse-time dependency

jdbc:
  * use tagalog expression parser
  * use tagalog-script as basis

infrastructure:
  * issue management setup
  * archive setup for mailing list (tagalog is like plexus and not like xfire or drools)
  * nag email address?
  * replace /dist/tagalog with link to ~tagalog/dist
