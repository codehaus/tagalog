<title>A framework for XML parsing</title>
</head>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
Tagalog is a collection of libraries targetted at the problem of parsing
XML files that have been written by humans.
The heart of the collection is
<a href="tagalog-core/index.html"><code>tagalog-core</code></a>,
which is a simple framework for parsing XML documents in Java.
<code>tagalog-core</code> is a thin layer over the top of an event-based
XML parser (either SAX or XPP in the core package, though
<code>tagalog</code> can be interfaced to other parsers quite easily).
Events are delivered to <em>tags</em> based on the namespace of the
corresponding element in a manner that is styled
after the similar mechanisms in
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/index.jsp">JSP</a> and
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/">Jelly</a>.
